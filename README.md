# LINAW-Proof-of-Concept
- This is a prototype of the open source thesis, "Blockchain Initiative LINAW: Ledger for Integrity, Neutrality, and Accountability on the Web."
- It will be a Software-as-a-Service that enables organizations, businesses, and local government units to practice open governance.

## Modules
1. Accounting information system.
2. Hyperledger Fabric V2 blockchain network + API.
3. *(Optional)* Public view dashboard to display documents, reports, and transactions.

## Prototype Tech Stack
This proof of concept will showcase [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/), an open-source Python framework that enables developers to deliver interactive applications. In addition to [Kaleido](https://www.kaleido.io/), an enterprise-grade platform that simplifies the building and running of blockchain networks.
- Streamlit will serve as the user interface for the accounting information system module and the optional public view dashboard module.
- Kaleido will manage the Hyperledger Fabric V2 blockchain and RESTful API calls.
