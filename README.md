## Modules
1. Accounting information system.
2. Hyperledger Fabric V2 blockchain network + API.
3. *(Optional)* Public view dashboard to display documents, reports, and transactions.

## Prototype Tech Stack
This proof of concept will showcase [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/), an open-source Python framework that enables developers to deliver interactive applications. Streamlit will serve as the user interface for the accounting information system module and the optional public view dashboard module.
